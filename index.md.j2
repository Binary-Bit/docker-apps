## Welcome!

This page list Docker containers I've created to run some popular applications.

All these containers are based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), a
security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution very popular to build Docker
containers.

Most implemented applications have a graphical user interface (GUI).  It can be
accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed
on client side) or via any VNC client.  The build-in web UI is very nice and
mobile-friendly.

## Applications

<table>
  <tbody>
{% for item in apps.name %}
{% set sysname = item|lower|replace(' ', '-') %}
    <tr><td>
      <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=raw.githubusercontent.com/jlesage/docker-templates/master/jlesage/images/{{ sysname }}-icon.png&amp;w=50" alt="{{ item }}"> <a href="https://github.com/jlesage/docker-{{ sysname }}">{{ item }}</a>
    </td></tr>
{% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>
